# Dependencies upgrade & .NET 9.0

## TL; DR 🎯

Update projects dependencies and add support and testing for .NET 9.0.

## NEW ✨

- Support for .NET 9.0 for all features & CI
- A `makefile` now replaces the `coverage.sh` and `docs.sh` scripts. It is now possible to run the tests using `make coverage` and `make docs` to generate the documentation. A `make install` also installs the dependencies.

## IMPROVED 📈

- Bumped dependencies to:
  - csharpier > v0.30.6
  - docfx > v2.78.2
  - yamldotnet > v16.3.0
  - MSTest.TestAdapter > v3.7.3
  - MSTest.TestFramework > v3.7.3
