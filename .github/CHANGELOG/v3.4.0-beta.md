# New Borders management

## TL; DR 🎯

Instead of roundedCorners boolean, we use BordersType enum

## NEW ✨

- `BordersType` enum: enumeration of all borders available (SingleStraight, SingleBold, SingleRounded, DoubleStraight, ASCII)
- `Borders` class: Manages elements borders giving characters depending on the borders type
- Replace rounded corners to Borders feature for: Matrix, TableView, TableSelector, Int and FloatSelector, Prompt, EmbedText, ElementsList, ElementsDashboard

## IMPROVED 📈

- Made '▶' default char when calling `UpdateSelector()` for elements using it
- CD: remove main blocking step
- CD: remove release notes useless extraction
- Minor updates on PR and release notes templates

## FIXED 🐛

- None.
