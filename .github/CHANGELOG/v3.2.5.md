# Minor docs update and new debug function

## TL; DR 🎯

New templates for PR and release notes, change of license, new debug function

## NEW ✨

- New debug function: Core.WriteDebugMark() overwrite anything on the console to display info
- New release note template: (in markdown, not yml), needs copy/paste to use
- Move License from GPL v3.0 to v2.0: be more permissive

## IMPROVED 📈

- Remove previous release note: yml template (not using further branch than dev so was not useful)
- Update PR template: cleaner and faster to use
- Minor update to coverage script

## FIXED 🐛

- None.
