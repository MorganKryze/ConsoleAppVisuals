# Table of content

In this section, you will find the list of all the elements available in the library. They will be accompanied by a brief description and a link to their respective documentation page.

They are divided into three categories:

- [Passive](/ConsoleAppVisuals/2-elements/passive.html): the default elements, which do not require any specific action from the user.
- [Interactive](/ConsoleAppVisuals/2-elements/interactive.html): like a menu or prompt, these elements require user input and interaction.
- [Animated](/ConsoleAppVisuals/2-elements/animated.html): elements that are animated, like progress bar.

> [!NOTE]
> An article is available to help you create your own elements. You can find it [here](/ConsoleAppVisuals/articles/create_element.html).
