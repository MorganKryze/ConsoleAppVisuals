### Versioning conventions

We use the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) convention for versioning. The version number is composed of three parts: Major, Minor, and Patch. We also use a suffix to denote pre-release versions (vX.Y.Z-PreRelease):

- Major. Breaking changes
- Minor: New features, but backwards compatible
- Patch: Backwards compatible bug fixes only
- -Suffix (optional): a hyphen followed by a string denoting a pre-release version (following the Semantic Versioning
  or SemVerÂ« convention).

For the pre-release suffix, we use the following conventions:

- -alpha: Alpha release, typically used for work-in-progress and experimentation.
- -beta: Beta release, typically one that is feature complete for the next planned release, but may contain known bugs.
- -rc: Release candidate, typically a release that's potentially final (stable) unless significant bugs emerge.

### Testing Conventions

For testing, we use the following conventions:

- Tests should be written in the `testing` directory.
- Tests filenames should follow the `ClassToTest.Tests.cs` pattern.
- Classes should have a `TestCleanup` function.
- Tests are written using the `MSTests` framework.
- Tests methods names should be descriptive and follow the `ElementToTest_BehaviorExpected` pattern.
- Tests should have the `TestMethod` attribute.
- Tests should have the `TestCategory("ClassToTest")` attribute.
- Tests content should follow the `Arrange`, `Act`, `Assert` pattern.

### Commit names conventions

For commit names, we use the github hooks:

- New feature: `:feat:` â€¢ ðŸŒŸ
- refactor: `:refactor:` â€¢ ðŸš§
- New tests: `:test:` â€¢ âœ…
- Update of project's CI/CD: `:ci:` â€¢ ðŸ¤–
- Update of documentation: `:docs:` â€¢ ðŸ“–
- Bug fix: `:fix:` â€¢ ðŸš‘
- Improve performances: `:perf:` â€¢ âš¡
- Aesthetic improvement: `:style:` â€¢ ðŸ’„

We also use the following conventions:

- Commit names should be written in the present tense.
- Commit names should be descriptive and concise.
